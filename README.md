# My Projects

## Rock Paper Scissors AI

I have built an AI that can determine whether your hand position is either rock, paper or scissors from a photo from a bird's eye view.
I did the whole project from start to finish: building the dataset, producing the model and then producing a mini game to have a fun interaction with the model.

## Would you rather? Website

A Next js app using the [T3 app tech stack](https://create.t3.gg/). It has github auth to enable me to moderate submitted would you rather? questions and uses trpc for CRUD operations. It is deployed using vercel and planetscale database. [ms-would-you-rather.vercel.app](https://ms-would-you-rather.vercel.app).
