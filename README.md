# My Projects

## Rock Paper Scissors AI

I have built an AI that can determine whether your hand position is either rock, paper or scissors from a photo from a bird's eye view.
I did the whole project from start to finish: building the dataset, producing the model and then producing a mini game to have a fun interaction with the model.

## Pomodoro Todo App

It is a django react app that is a pomodoro timer and a todo app.
The app has a CRUD rest api which is what the react app interacts. 
The api includes token authentication using django rest knox.
