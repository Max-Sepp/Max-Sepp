# My Projects

## Rock Paper Scissors AI

I have built an AI that can determine whether your hand position is either rock, paper or scissors from a photo from a bird's eye view.
I did the whole project from start to finish: building the dataset, producing the model and then producing a mini game to have a fun interaction with the model.

## CSV DB

Golang Project that implements indexing of a csv file using a B-Tree.
